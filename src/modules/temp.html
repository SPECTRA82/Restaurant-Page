                The Baratie was born from a promise—a promise made by Captain 
                Zeff to a starving young pirate named Sanji. After surviving a 
                shipwreck and sharing their last morsels of food, Zeff vowed to 
                create a haven for hungry souls. And so, the Baratie set sail—a 
                sanctuary where flavors collide, and stories unfold.
